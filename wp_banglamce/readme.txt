I developed wp_bangla_avro tinymce plugin to write bangla in tinmce editor. In Bangladesh we are crazy to write bangla in web in any condition.
I made this plugin for wordpress to use this plugin in wordpress editor in visual mode (that means tinymce is enabled)

How to use:
1. Download the zip given here for download and then unzip
2.copy the folder wp_bangla_avro to your wordpress plugin directory.
3.Active the pugin.
4.Try to write any new post in visual mode.
